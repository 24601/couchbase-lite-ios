**Couchbase Lite** is an embedded lightweight, document-oriented (NoSQL), syncable database engine. This isn't it's official site -- just an informal development blog for the Cocoa version.

You can get more info, documentation and downloads at [the Couchbase mobile developer portal](http://developer.couchbase.com/mobile/).

Of course the source code is [on Github](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/).
